# New Years Resolution Bot #
Accountability incoming...
-----------
### What
The New Years Resolution Bot is a discord bot created to motivate users to log their new year resolutions, remind them about these resolutions and provide accountability and motivation to help achieve those goals. 

### How

The New Years Resolution Bot is coded in [*Pycord*](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord) and [*Python MySQL Connector*](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/). The bot is coded entirely in slash commands.

### Where

Currently the bot is only functional in [one server](https://discord.gg/7Pjjf2XTFw) as this bot was created specifically for the server. Functionality to allow use in other servers will be developed later on
